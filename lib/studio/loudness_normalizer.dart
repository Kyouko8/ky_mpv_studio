/// scan (`player.stream.loudness`).
///
/// The loudness is ALWAYS measured (it rides the waveform analyzer's single
/// decode pass), regardless of the toggle: the result feeds both normalization
/// AND the Now Playing info sheet, so opening the sheet finds the measurement
/// ready instead of arming a fresh decode (which would restart the scan from
/// zero). The "Normalize volume" toggle only controls whether the measured
/// gain is APPLIED.
///
/// The gain rides mpv's `volume-gain` (a dB stage separate from the user
/// volume slider), so toggling normalization never touches the user's volume
/// setting. Tracks the scan cannot measure up-front (adaptive or live streams
/// report `unavailable`) play at unity gain.
